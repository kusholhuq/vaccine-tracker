# Vaccine Tracker
An interactive display of the latest distribution data for the Covid-19 vaccine, possibly a clone of the [NY Times Tracker](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html)

### Latest Data
The app displays the latest data pulled directly from the [`CDC API`](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf).

### Feature Set
The interactive map allows you to: 
* Select any state to view detailed data
* Control select multiple states to sum data
* Alter "vaccine progress" color gradient
